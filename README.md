HOAX - Emergency System

This is just a Proof of Concept for our Application HOAX.
This application will let the nearby hospitals know that there has been an accident. The ambulance route is shown the shortest possible path to the accident site. Built by using HTML & CSS (for now) and will develop the application using AI Tools.

FEATURES:

-Emergency Button: This button is highlighted because the main goal of this application is to provide easy services in emergency situations.
		  By clicking this button, the nearest hospital will get the alert and the hospital can make arrangements before hand to 		  give the patient a fast treatment

-Search Bar: Helps the people with this app to locate nearest hospital. The map will only show Hospital Legends, so there are no 	  	    distractions.

-The Message pop-up: The message pop-up indicates the usage of 'Audio Generation AI', which will be helpful in reducing the person's anxiety 	            even by a little bit. 

-Speed Circle: This will show the speed of the person's vehicle, this is connected with an accelerometer which is monitored by an 'Anomaly 		Detection Model' which will activate the 'emergency button' when an anomaly occurs.



'This app is helpful for everyone with a smartphone in hand, even if we take rural areas into account, most if the residents have smartphones, even if one with a smartphone is nearby we can save a life.'
